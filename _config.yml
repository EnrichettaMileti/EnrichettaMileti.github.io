  Hi there, my name is Enrichetta. I'm a bioinformatician, studying ...
  In 2012 I got my bachelor degree in Biology at the [University of L'Aquila](https://www.univq.it).
  In the meanwhile, the importance of Bioinformatics in biological analysis has become more and more important and my curiosity in use it as well.
  This prompted me to join the International Master in Bioinformatics in 2013 at [University of Bologna](https://www.unibo.it) and I acquired a master's degree in July 2014.
  In October 2014, I joined the [Carsten Daub group](https://www.daublab.org) as Scientific Trainee and starting from March 2015 I am PhD student.

  When I'm not sat at my desk I am very active and spend most of my time outdoors. I do a lot a sports such as
  mountain biking, road cycling, kitesuring and horse riding as well as trying to make time for things like
  rock climbing and playing some rugby. Since my time at university I have become a very keen Kitesurfer and freestyle
  Landboarder. In 2014 I competed and won the amateur landboard British powerkite tour.

  I'm interested in photography and videography as I like to be creative, this is mainly through sport but
  I enjoy landscape and abstract photography too. I like to showcase my work on instagram if
  you would like to take a look - [jameswgrant](https://www.instagram.com/jameswgrant/).

  Finally during the rest of my free time you will either find me working on my bikes, rock climbing at one of
  Bristol's indoor climbing centres or down the Rec supporting Bath Rugby.
