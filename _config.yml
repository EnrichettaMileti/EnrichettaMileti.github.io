  Hi there, my name is Enrichetta. I'm a bioinformatician, studying ...
  In 2012 I got my bachelor degree in Biology at the [University of L'Aquila](https://www.univq.it).
  In the meanwhile, the importance of Bioinformatics in biological analysis has become more and more important and my curiosity in use it as well.
  This prompted me to join the International Master in Bioinformatics in 2013 at [University of Bologna](https://www.unibo.it) and I acquired a master's degree in July 2014.
  In October 2014, I joined the [Carsten Daub group](https://www.daublab.org) as Scientific Trainee and starting from March 2015 I am PhD student.

          During my time at Harvard I learnt most of my key skills that have I have taken through my career such as teamwork and working to tight deadlines. I thouroughly enjoyed my time as university and learnt a lot about a healthy work life balance.

          I spent a lot of my free time as a committee member of the *Harvard Mountaineering Club* taking on roles such as *Trip Secretary* and *Vice-President*.
