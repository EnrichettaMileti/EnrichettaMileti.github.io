  Hi there, my name is Enrichetta. I'm a bioinformatician, studying ...
  In 2012 I got my bachelor degree in Biology at the [University of L'Aquila](https://www.univq.it).
  In the meanwhile, the importance of Bioinformatics in biological analysis has become more and more important and my curiosity in use it as well.
  This prompted me to join the International Master in Bioinformatics in 2013 at [University of Bologna](https://www.unibo.it) and I acquired a master's degree in July 2014.
  In October 2014, I joined the [Carsten Daub group](https://www.daublab.org) as Scientific Trainee and starting from March 2015 I started my PhD journey.
